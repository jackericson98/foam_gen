Welcome to `foam_gen`, an interactive simulated foam generator. This project is designed to create 3-dimensional random ensembles of spheres, mimicking the bubbles in foam based on user-defined parameters. This program was initially designed to be used 

## Features

- Generate 3D random ensembles of spheres.
- Customize the size, distribution, and interaction of spheres.
- Export the generated foam structure for further analysis or visualization.
