Welcome to `foam_gen`, an interactive simulated foam generator. This project is designed to create 3-dimensional random ensembles of spheres, mimicking the bubbles in foam based on user-defined parameters. This program was initially designed to be used 

## Features

- Generate 3D random ensembles of spheres.
- Customize the size, distribution, and interaction of spheres.
- Export the generated foam structure for further analysis or visualization.

## Installation

To get started with `foam_gen`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jackericson98/foam_gen.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd foam_gen
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The simplest example of `foam_gen` is to run it from the terminal in the `foam_gen` folder:

```bash
python foam_gen.py
```
This will trigger the foam_gen GUI:

The GUI can then be used to define your foam and outputs. When ready select the `Create Foam` button and the foam will be created under the set paramaters. These paramaters are described below. 

## Parameters



## Outputs


    cat annotated_contacts.txt | voronota expand-descriptors | column -t > expanded_table_of_contacts.txt
